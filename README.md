# Back-End

Principle of calculation of exit time and human position:  
  If the number of all classes (people, body, head) is the same, the counting formula is as follows:  
    **FuncP = pos + posOff**  
    where:  
    - pos — position people  
    - posOff — position online people  
  Else:  
    **FuncP = int((p + h + b) / 3) + posOff**  
    where:  
    - posOff — position online people  
    - p, h, b — people, head, body classes (respectively)
